# [Premi√®re Semaine - First Week(https://github.com/le-oasis/DataEngineeringZoomCamp/tree/main/Premi%C3%A8re%20Semaine%20-%20First%20Week): 

- During the first week, we established the foundation of our data pipeline project, focusing on Docker setup, data ingestion, and initial exploration. 
- Key tasks included downloading NY Taxi data, creating a Docker environment, setting up PostgreSQL for data storage, and beginning data exploration with Jupyter Notebooks. 
- This week was critical in laying the groundwork for our scalable data pipeline.
